# weather-assessment
## Project Brief
Build a 3-
tier application from scratch using Angular, Node.js and a DB. Your task is
to create an application that displays real-time weather, forecast, and air
pollution data for state capitals in the USA using the open-source weather
API https:/open-meteo.com/ to pull data the real time. The Angular UI
should consume a REST API specified with OpenAPI3 and implemented
with Node.js. The application should maintain a history of lookups done
using the app that can be retrieved and viewed in the UI.
