# weather-assessment
## Project Brief
Build a 3-
tier application from scratch using Angular, Node.js and a DB. Your task is
to create an application that displays real-time weather, forecast, and air
pollution data for state capitals in the USA using the open-source weather
API https:/open-meteo.com/ to pull data the real time. The Angular UI
should consume a REST API specified with OpenAPI3 and implemented
with Node.js. The application should maintain a history of lookups done
using the app that can be retrieved and viewed in the UI.

## Built With
- Node: `v18.16.0`
- Yarn: `1.22.17`

## Angular UI
View the [weather-assessment-ui/Readme.md](weather-assessment-ui/Readme.md) located in weather-assessment-ui folder to build/run/test

The `ng new ...` command was used to bootstrap the UI


## Node/Mongo Backend
View the [weather-assessment-api/Readme.md](weather-assessment-api/Readme.md) located in weather-assessment-api folder to build/run/test

A tutorial was followed for the boilerplate for the API portion:
